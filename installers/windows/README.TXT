This directory contains the files needed to build a single Windows executable
file (install pywin32 from its website and then pyinstaller through pip)
and a Windows installer (install NSIS version 2.X).

Use a 32-bit version of python 2.7 for maximum portability of the produced files.

Create the files with:

python build.py

The output files are created in the dist directory of your eyegrade source directory.
