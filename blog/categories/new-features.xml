(part 2)</title><link>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/what-will-eyegrade-05-include-part-2.html</link><dc:creator>Jesús Arias Fisteus</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post describes another feature that will be available
in eyegrade 0.5 (see &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/what-will-eyegrade-05-include-part-1.html"&gt;the first installment of this series of posts&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've largely reworked the code that handles the student lists.
In eyegrade 0.5 you'll see two visible changes regarding this.
Firstly, you'll be able to specify the first and last name of
students in two separate fields.
Secondly, there is a new dialog for entering,
while grading an exam,
new students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separating first and last name will be optional.
Eyegrade will infer, from the student lists it imports,
whether you are providing separate first and last name fields,
or the whole name together in just one field.
When exporting grades, you'll have control
over which name fields get exported and will be able
to sort the listing by last name if you wish so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the second change,
there will be a new button
in the dialog for editing the student id
that lets you open a dialog for entering the data
for a student that is not in your student lists:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Screenshot of the new version of the student id edit dialog" class="thumbnail" src="http://www.eyegrade.org/galleries/screenshots-05/change-id-preview.png"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dialog asks for the numerical id, first name, last name and email.
Only the numerical id is mandatory.
This is the current look of the dialog,
although it might change before the release:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;

I'm currently busy adding some new features to eyegrade.
Some of them are already integrated into the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jfisteus/eyegrade/tree/development"&gt;development branch at GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.
The plan is releasing them with eyegrade 0.5 sometime in January.
I'm not sure yet which new features will make it into the release but,
starting with this post,
I'll describe some of them once they are more or less ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first feature I'll talk about is actually a fix
for a counter-intuitive behavior
of the right-side view of exams
(the one I introduced in eyegrade 0.3
that shows miniatures of the exams
that have been graded in the current session).
Up to now,
the miniature was not immediately updated
when the webcam captured a new exam
or you edited something on a previously graded exam.
It was updated later, when you changed to another exam
or started to grade a new one.
That was somewhat confusing for many users.
From version 0.5 onward
the miniatures will get updated immediately
when the webcam captures a new exam or you edit an exam.
I believe that having that immediate feedback
will improve the overall user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More posts will follow with the description of other
new features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>eyegrade</category><category>new-features</category><guid>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/what-will-eyegrade-05-include-part-1.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2014 13:46:16 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
