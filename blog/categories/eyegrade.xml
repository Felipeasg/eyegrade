(part 3)</title><link>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/what-will-eyegrade-05-include-part-3.html</link><dc:creator>Jesús Arias Fisteus</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuing the series of posts
that describe the new features of the future eyegrade 0.5 release
(see the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/what-will-eyegrade-05-include-part-1.html"&gt;first&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/what-will-eyegrade-05-include-part-2.html"&gt;second&lt;/a&gt; posts),
I'll introduce today a new one:
the possibility to assign separate scores to different questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, the system assumed that all the questions had the same weight
when computing the score for an exam.
For example, suppose an exam with 10 questions,
in which correct answers add 1 point to the score
and incorrect answers subtract 1/3 points (one third of a point).
A student having 7 correct and 3 incorrect answers
will get 6 points (7 * 1 - 3 * 1/3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the new feature,
not all the questions need to be awarded the same score.
Important questions may get bigger scores than others.
In order to do that, you define a base score
(e.g. 2 points for correct answers and -2/3 for incorrect ones)
and a relative &lt;em&gt;weight&lt;/em&gt; for each question.
The &lt;em&gt;weight&lt;/em&gt; of a question is a factor that multiplies the base score
in order to get the actual score of that question.
For example, for a question you want to score double than the base score
(4 points for correct answers and -4/3 for incorrect ones)
you would set a weight of 2.
For a question you want to have exactly the base score,
you would set a weight of 1.
You can even decrease the score of a question with respect to he base score.
A weight of 1/2 would mean
1 point for correct answers and -1/3 for incorrect ones
in our example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll be able to edit the weights of the questions
in one of the steps of the wizard that creates a new session.
In that page you select between having no scores,
the same score for all the questions
and the new weights-based variable score system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Choosing the scoring mode" class="thumbnail" src="http://www.eyegrade.org/galleries/screenshots-05/choose-score-mode.png"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you select the last option,
you'll edit the scores in the table at the bottom of the dialog:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="View of the table for entering question weights" class="thumbnail" src="http://www.eyegrade.org/galleries/screenshots-05/weights-table.png"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can enter in each cell integer numbers (e.g. "2"),
fractions (e.g. "1/2")
or decimal numbers with fractional digits (e.g. "2.5").
If you have several exam models
(alternative orderings of the questions),
eyegrade will check that you enter the same weights
in all the models, possibly in a different order for each model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Error message when the weights in some models are different" class="thumbnail" src="http://www.eyegrade.org/galleries/screenshots-05/error-different-weights.png"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, if your session configuration file
contains the permutations done to each model
(if you create the documents of your exams with eyegrade,
it will),
eyegrade automatically updates the value in all the models
every time you change the weight of a question in one of them.
However, if the file does not contain the permutations,
you'll need to enter the weights for each model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also updated the dialog that, given a desired maximum score,
configures the score for each question.
Click on the &lt;em&gt;compute default scores&lt;/em&gt; button
&lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; you have entered the weights
and eyegrade will choose the base score
so that the maximum possible grade is the one you choose,
taking into account the weights you set:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Dialog for computing the base score from the desired maximum score" class="thumbnail" src="http://www.eyegrade.org/galleries/screenshots-05/compute-scores.png"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep tuned for more updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>eyegrade</category><category>new-features</category><guid>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/what-will-eyegrade-05-include-part-3.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2015 21:03:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>What will eyegrade 0.5 include? (part 2)</title><link>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/what-will-eyegrade-05-include-part-2.html</link><dc:creator>Jesús Arias Fisteus</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post describes another feature that will be available
in eyegrade 0.5 (see &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/what-will-eyegrade-05-include-part-1.html"&gt;the first installment of this series of posts&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've largely reworked the code that handles the student lists.
In eyegrade 0.5 you'll see two visible changes regarding this.
Firstly, you'll be able to specify the first and last name of
students in two separate fields.
Secondly, there is a new dialog for entering,
while grading an exam,
new students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separating first and last name will be optional.
Eyegrade will infer, from the student lists it imports,
whether you are providing separate first and last name fields,
or the whole name together in just one field.
When exporting grades, you'll have control
over which name fields get exported and will be able
to sort the listing by last name if you wish so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the second change,
there will be a new button
in the dialog for editing the student id
that lets you open a dialog for entering the data
for a student that is not in your student lists:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Screenshot of the new version of the student id edit dialog" class="thumbnail" src="http://www.eyegrade.org/galleries/screenshots-05/change-id-preview.png"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dialog asks for the numerical id, first name, last name and email.
Only the numerical id is mandatory.
This is the current look of the dialog,
although it might change before the release:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Screenshot of the new dialog for adding a new student" class="thumbnail" src="http://www.eyegrade.org/galleries/screenshots-05/new-student-preview.png"&gt;

(part 1)</title><link>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/what-will-eyegrade-05-include-part-1.html</link><dc:creator>Jesús Arias Fisteus</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from fixing some minor issues here and there,
I'm currently busy adding some new features to eyegrade.
Some of them are already integrated into the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jfisteus/eyegrade/tree/development"&gt;development branch at GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.
The plan is releasing them with eyegrade 0.5 sometime in January.
I'm not sure yet which new features will make it into the release but,
starting with this post,
I'll describe some of them once they are more or less ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first feature I'll talk about is actually a fix
for a counter-intuitive behavior
of the right-side view of exams
(the one I introduced in eyegrade 0.3
that shows miniatures of the exams
that have been graded in the current session).
Up to now,
the miniature was not immediately updated
when the webcam captured a new exam
or you edited something on a previously graded exam.
It was updated later, when you changed to another exam
or started to grade a new one.
That was somewhat confusing for many users.
From version 0.5 onward
the miniatures will get updated immediately
when the webcam captures a new exam or you edit an exam.
I believe that having that immediate feedback
will improve the overall user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More posts will follow with the description of other
new features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>eyegrade</category><category>new-features</category><guid>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/what-will-eyegrade-05-include-part-1.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2014 13:46:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Eyegrade 0.4.4 released</title><link>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/eyegrade-044-released.html</link><dc:creator>Jesús Arias Fisteus</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've just released Eyegrade 0.4.4.
This version fixes a bug introduced by
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/eyegrade-043-released.html"&gt;the bugfix of version 0.4.3&lt;/a&gt;.
Version 0.4.3 solved the problem for
the older versions of Python,
but inadvertently introduced exactly the same problem
for the newer versions,
which were previously unaffected.
I've reverted the erroneous fix
and solved the problem
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jfisteus/eyegrade/commit/e03da3762e748913db89e6470b3fe85b02f367df"&gt;in a better way&lt;/a&gt;.
This new version should be able to export grades
in any 2.6 and 2.7 version of Python,
both Windows and Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the only change with respect to version 0.4.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, if you have installed Eyegrade through &lt;em&gt;git&lt;/em&gt;,
you can easily update the program by executing the command
&lt;em&gt;git pull&lt;/em&gt; from inside the directory in which Eyegrade is installed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>bugfix</category><category>eyegrade</category><category>release</category><guid>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/eyegrade-044-released.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2014 17:46:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Eyegrade 0.4.3 released</title><link>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/eyegrade-043-released.html</link><dc:creator>Jesús Arias Fisteus</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've just released Eyegrade 0.4.3.
This release fixes a bug
that made the functionality that exports grades fail
when the program is run
with the Python 2.6 version I distribute for Windows.
Linux users with a reasonably recent version of Python
were not affected.
This is the only change with respect to version 0.4.2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have installed Eyegrade through &lt;em&gt;git&lt;/em&gt;, you can easily update
the program by executing the command
&lt;em&gt;git pull&lt;/em&gt; from inside the directory in which Eyegrade is installed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>bugfix</category><category>eyegrade</category><category>release</category><guid>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/eyegrade-043-released.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2014 18:43:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Improved documentation about how to edit an exam with LaTeX</title><link>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/improved-documentation-about-how-to-edit-an-exam-with-latex.html</link><dc:creator>Jesús Arias Fisteus</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;official&lt;/em&gt; way of editting your exams for Eyegrade
consists of creating an XML file with the questions,
running on it the &lt;cite&gt;create_exam&lt;/cite&gt; script provided by Eyegrade
and compiling the resulting files with LaTeX
in order to get the final PDF documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although exams can also be edited
with a word processor such as OpenOffice or Microsoft Word
(see &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eyegrade.org/doc/user-manual/#creating-the-exams-in-a-word-processor"&gt;Creating the exams in a word processor&lt;/a&gt;),
following the official way has some advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eyegrade shuffles the questions
and produces several models with different question orderings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eyegrade creates the exam configuration file (the &lt;cite&gt;.eye&lt;/cite&gt; file)
automatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LaTeX-style equations may be used inside the questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, editing an XML file and dealing with LaTeX
may scare some users
that are more used to graphical word processors.
In order to make the procedure more approachable,
the user manual describes now more in depth how to edit exams
the official way in the section
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eyegrade.org/doc/user-manual/#editing-exams"&gt;Editing exams&lt;/a&gt;.
Suggestions on how to improve that section further
are most welcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>documentation</category><category>eyegrade</category><guid>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/improved-documentation-about-how-to-edit-an-exam-with-latex.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2014 23:28:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Eyegrade 0.4 released!</title><link>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/eyegrade-04-released.html</link><dc:creator>Jesús Arias Fisteus</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've released eyegrade 0.4 (actually, eyegrade 0.4.2 after a couple of
minor changes and a bug fix). There is only one main change in this
release with respect to the 0.3 series, the ability to export grade
listings from the user interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you select in the menu &lt;em&gt;Exams / Export grade listing&lt;/em&gt; you get a dialog
like the following one that allows you to configure the export options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="The new export dialog." class="thumbnail" src="http://www.eyegrade.org/galleries/screenshots-04/export-dialog.png"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new feature is easier to use and more flexible than the
&lt;cite&gt;mix_grades&lt;/cite&gt; script that was available in the previous versions. The
script is now obsolete and will probably be removed in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>eyegrade</category><category>release</category><guid>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/eyegrade-04-released.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2014 18:25:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Eyegrade 0.3 released!</title><link>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/eyegrade-03-released.html</link><dc:creator>Jesús Arias Fisteus</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've just released eyegrade 0.3. The main changes in this version are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previously, exams could only be reviewed immediately after capturing
them. Now you can review the exams, change answers or change the
student id any time you open the session.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A consequence of the previous change is that now grading does not
start automatically when the session is opened. Once you open a
session, you can view or edit the exams you have already graded, or
click on the &lt;em&gt;Start grading&lt;/em&gt; action in the menu / toolbar in order
to start grading more exams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The graphical user interface is now prepared for translations. This
release features an interface in English, Spanish, Galician and
Catalan. Volunteers for other languages are welcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are changes to the layout of the graphical user
interface. There is a vertical area at the left were the thumbnails
of the exams graded for this session are displayed. In addition,
there is a new status bar at the bottom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other fixes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be aware that the sessions created with eyegrade 0.3 are not
compatible with previous versions. Conversely, sessions created with
previous versions cannot be opened with eyegrade 0.3. The reason is
that now session are stored internally as a SQLite database and store
more information about the exams than the previous versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have installed eyegrade through &lt;em&gt;git&lt;/em&gt;, you can easily update
the program from versions in the series 0.2.x by executing the command
&lt;em&gt;git pull&lt;/em&gt; from inside the directory in which eyegrade is installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find bugs or problems with this new release, please open an
issue at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jfisteus/eyegrade/"&gt;the GitHub project page&lt;/a&gt;, or just let me know by
commenting on this post or sending me an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>eyegrade</category><category>release</category><guid>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/eyegrade-03-released.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2014 00:37:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Eyegrade moved to a new location</title><link>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/eyegrade-moved-to-a-new-location.html</link><dc:creator>Jesús Arias Fisteus</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've just moved Eyegrade to a new Web location at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://eyegrade.org/"&gt;eyegrade.org&lt;/a&gt;. These are the important links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project homepage: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://eyegrade.org/"&gt;http://eyegrade.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User manual: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://eyegrade.org/doc/user-manual/"&gt;http://eyegrade.org/doc/user-manual/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blog: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://eyegrade.org/blog/"&gt;http://eyegrade.org/blog/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RSS feed: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://eyegrade.org/blog/rss.xml"&gt;http://eyegrade.org/blog/rss.xml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requests for the old addresses will automatically be redirected to the
new location. However, the old server may be down for some periods of
August. In fact, the frequent downtimes of the old hosting are one of
the main reasons for the change. During those downtime periods
redirections won't work. However, the new addresses will work properly
even in that case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new website is hosted at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pages.github.com/"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; service. My experience so far with this
service has been very satisfactory. The availability of the website
with the new hosting will definitely be much better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>eyegrade</category><guid>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/eyegrade-moved-to-a-new-location.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2013 16:55:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Requests for Eyegrade 0.3</title><link>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/requests-for-eyegrade-03.html</link><dc:creator>Jesús Arias Fisteus</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm planning the next major release (0.3) of Eyegrade for
September. There are some features I have in mind, but listening to
the users from time to time does not harm ;) If there is a feature you
are especially interested in, just let me know by commenting on this
post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from some polishing here and there, these are things I'm
thinking about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right now, you can review and fix detection errors in an exam only
at the moment you scan it. What if you discover an error later on?
It think it would be great if the interface allowed you to open a
grading session anytime later and use the same reviewing/fixing
features.  This feature would probably include a list of students
and grades in the interface, so that you can quickly access the exam
of a specific student.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A user interface for entering the questions of an exam, creating the
PDFs, etc. This would probably include dropping LaTeX in favor of
something else (my main option is the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.reportlab.com/software/opensource/"&gt;ReportLab library&lt;/a&gt;). Using the
current command-line interface and LaTeX would still be possible,
but not the preferred method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making life easier for users that only want to use Eyegrade for
grading, but not for creating the exams. I include here features
such as creating a &lt;cite&gt;.eye&lt;/cite&gt; file through guided dialogues or creating
the PDF of a personalized answer sheet in the user interface.  It's
about time to close &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jfisteus/eyegrade/issues/36"&gt;issue 36&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adapting the user interface for multiple languages. I can start with
an English, Spanish and Galician interface, and wait for volunteers
to translate it to other tongues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't have time for all the features in the list, so you can help me
to prioritize. Of course, you can also request features not in the
list ;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>eyegrade</category><category>requests</category><guid>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/requests-for-eyegrade-03.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2013 18:45:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
