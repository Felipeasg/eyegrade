This release includes just one main feature
that the users that don't build their exams with LaTeX
will find useful:
there is no need anymore to edit an exam configuration file
(the &lt;cite&gt;.eye&lt;/cite&gt; file)
manually.
Now you can choose,
when you create a new grading session,
to configure the session from a configuration file
or manually through the user interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Choosing how to configure the exam" class="thumbnail" src="http://www.eyegrade.org/galleries/screenshots-06/new-session-wizard-manual-1.png"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feature has been developed
by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jaraneda"&gt;Jonathan Araneda&lt;/a&gt;
from Chile.
In addition,
Roberto González set the requirements for this feature,
provided quite useful suggestions,
tested the new code
and sponsored Jonathan's work.
Thanks to both of them for their useful contribution!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you choose the to configure the exam from a file,
all works like in the previous versions:
you just load the configuration file and proceed as always.
However,
if you choose to configure the exam manually,
you'll be able to enter the following data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of digits of the student id numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of choices per question.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The geometry of the answer tables
(how many tables and how many questions per table).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of models of the exam
(number of different exams you produced
by permuting the questions and their answers).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The key of the exam
(the correct choice for every question in every model).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Entering configuration parameters" class="thumbnail" src="http://www.eyegrade.org/galleries/screenshots-06/new-session-wizard-manual-2.png"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Editing the key of the exam" class="thumbnail" src="http://www.eyegrade.org/galleries/screenshots-06/new-session-wizard-manual-3.png"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These dialogs are documented in the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eyegrade.org/doc/user-manual/index.html#manual-configuration-of-the-exam"&gt;user manual&lt;/a&gt;.
In addition,
the configuration you entered can be exported
as a configuration file so that
you or your colleges can create new sessions with the same configuration
(see the &lt;em&gt;Tools&lt;/em&gt; menu).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait,
what happened to the new OCR system
that &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/what-will-eyegrade-06-include-part-1.html"&gt;I announced for the 0.6 release&lt;/a&gt;?
Unfortunately, I have to leave it for later.
Although it is ready,
it depends on some other changes regarding the installation procedure
that are not yet finished.
I prefer to keep them for the next release
in order to avoid delaying the session configuration feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>eyegrade</category><category>release</category><guid>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/eyegrade-06-released.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jun 2015 09:13:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Bugfix release 0.5.1</title><link>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/bugfix-release-051.html</link><dc:creator>Jesús Arias Fisteus</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've released Eyegrade 0.5.1.
This version does not include any new feature,
but addresses a bug
that caused an empty spurious exam
to be stores in the session database
through the &lt;em&gt;capture exam&lt;/em&gt; feature,
when used before the answer table of the current exam
were detected at least once.
Eyegrade would refuse to open this session anymore.
This release prevents the spurious exam to be stored in that case.
Additionally,
it allows Eyegrade to open the session
even when such an exam made its way into the session database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, you can update with &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;git pull&lt;/tt&gt;
if you installed Eyegrade through &lt;em&gt;git&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>bugfix</category><category>eyegrade</category><category>release</category><guid>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/bugfix-release-051.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2015 22:51:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Eyegrade 0.5 released!</title><link>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/eyegrade-05-released.html</link><dc:creator>Jesús Arias Fisteus</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've finally released Eyegrade 0.5.
As I've advanced in the previous four posts,
its new features are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It stores exam captures and updates their miniatures immediately
when they are captured or you edit an answer or the student id
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/what-will-eyegrade-05-include-part-1.html"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've reworked the subsystem that manages the identity of the students.
Optionally, students may now have separate first and last name,
and there is a new dialog for entering new students
when they aren't in your student lists
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/what-will-eyegrade-05-include-part-2.html"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eyegrade.org/doc/user-manual/index.html#student-list-files"&gt;explanation in the user manual&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each question in a exam can have now a different weight in the final scores.
This way, you can assign a bigger weight to the most important questions
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/what-will-eyegrade-05-include-part-3.html"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eyegrade.org/doc/user-manual/index.html#scores"&gt;explanation in the user manual&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don't want a question to contribute to the score of the exam,
now you can do it when creating the session.
For example, it is useful when you discover an error
in the statement of a question,
but it's too late for fixing it.
With this feature you can avoid grading that question
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/what-will-eyegrade-05-include-part-4.html"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eyegrade.org/doc/user-manual/index.html#modifying-the-student-id"&gt;explanation in the user manual&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have installed eyegrade through &lt;em&gt;git&lt;/em&gt;, you can easily update
the program from versions in the series 0.2.x and later
by executing the command
&lt;em&gt;git pull&lt;/em&gt; from inside the directory in which Eyegrade is installed
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eyegrade.org/doc/user-manual/index.html#updating-eyegrade"&gt;explanation in the user manual&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be aware that Eyegrade 0.5 uses an updated session database schema.
Although Eyegrade 0.5 is able to work
with sessions created by the previous versions of Eyegrade,
those previous versions don't work
with sessions created by Eyegrade 0.5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>eyegrade</category><category>release</category><guid>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/eyegrade-05-released.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 23 Mar 2015 18:39:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Eyegrade 0.4.4 released</title><link>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/eyegrade-044-released.html</link><dc:creator>Jesús Arias Fisteus</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've just released Eyegrade 0.4.4.
This version fixes a bug introduced by
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/eyegrade-043-released.html"&gt;the bugfix of version 0.4.3&lt;/a&gt;.
Version 0.4.3 solved the problem for
the older versions of Python,
but inadvertently introduced exactly the same problem
for the newer versions,
which were previously unaffected.
I've reverted the erroneous fix
and solved the problem
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jfisteus/eyegrade/commit/e03da3762e748913db89e6470b3fe85b02f367df"&gt;in a better way&lt;/a&gt;.
This new version should be able to export grades
in any 2.6 and 2.7 version of Python,
both Windows and Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the only change with respect to version 0.4.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, if you have installed Eyegrade through &lt;em&gt;git&lt;/em&gt;,
you can easily update the program by executing the command
&lt;em&gt;git pull&lt;/em&gt; from inside the directory in which Eyegrade is installed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>bugfix</category><category>eyegrade</category><category>release</category><guid>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/eyegrade-044-released.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2014 17:46:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Eyegrade 0.4.3 released</title><link>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/eyegrade-043-released.html</link><dc:creator>Jesús Arias Fisteus</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've just released Eyegrade 0.4.3.
This release fixes a bug
that made the functionality that exports grades fail
when the program is run
with the Python 2.6 version I distribute for Windows.
Linux users with a reasonably recent version of Python
were not affected.
This is the only change with respect to version 0.4.2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have installed Eyegrade through &lt;em&gt;git&lt;/em&gt;, you can easily update
the program by executing the command
&lt;em&gt;git pull&lt;/em&gt; from inside the directory in which Eyegrade is installed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>bugfix</category><category>eyegrade</category><category>release</category><guid>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/eyegrade-043-released.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2014 18:43:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Eyegrade 0.4 released!</title><link>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/eyegrade-04-released.html</link><dc:creator>Jesús Arias Fisteus</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've released eyegrade 0.4 (actually, eyegrade 0.4.2 after a couple of
minor changes and a bug fix). There is only one main change in this
release with respect to the 0.3 series, the ability to export grade
listings from the user interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you select in the menu &lt;em&gt;Exams / Export grade listing&lt;/em&gt; you get a dialog
like the following one that allows you to configure the export options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="The new export dialog." class="thumbnail" src="http://www.eyegrade.org/galleries/screenshots-04/export-dialog.png"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new feature is easier to use and more flexible than the
&lt;cite&gt;mix_grades&lt;/cite&gt; script that was available in the previous versions. The
script is now obsolete and will probably be removed in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>eyegrade</category><category>release</category><guid>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/eyegrade-04-released.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2014 18:25:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Eyegrade 0.3 released!</title><link>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/eyegrade-03-released.html</link><dc:creator>Jesús Arias Fisteus</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've just released eyegrade 0.3. The main changes in this version are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previously, exams could only be reviewed immediately after capturing
them. Now you can review the exams, change answers or change the
student id any time you open the session.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A consequence of the previous change is that now grading does not
start automatically when the session is opened. Once you open a
session, you can view or edit the exams you have already graded, or
click on the &lt;em&gt;Start grading&lt;/em&gt; action in the menu / toolbar in order
to start grading more exams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The graphical user interface is now prepared for translations. This
release features an interface in English, Spanish, Galician and
Catalan. Volunteers for other languages are welcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are changes to the layout of the graphical user
interface. There is a vertical area at the left were the thumbnails
of the exams graded for this session are displayed. In addition,
there is a new status bar at the bottom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other fixes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be aware that the sessions created with eyegrade 0.3 are not
compatible with previous versions. Conversely, sessions created with
previous versions cannot be opened with eyegrade 0.3. The reason is
that now session are stored internally as a SQLite database and store
more information about the exams than the previous versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have installed eyegrade through &lt;em&gt;git&lt;/em&gt;, you can easily update
the program from versions in the series 0.2.x by executing the command
&lt;em&gt;git pull&lt;/em&gt; from inside the directory in which eyegrade is installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find bugs or problems with this new release, please open an
issue at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jfisteus/eyegrade/"&gt;the GitHub project page&lt;/a&gt;, or just let me know by
commenting on this post or sending me an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>eyegrade</category><category>release</category><guid>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/eyegrade-03-released.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2014 00:37:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Eyegrade 0.2 released!</title><link>http://www.eyegrade.org/blog/posts/release-eyegrade-0.2.html</link><dc:creator>Jesús Arias Fisteus</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eyegrade 0.2 has been released! It features the shiny new PyQt-based
user interface that I showed in previous posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.it.uc3m.es/jaf/eyegrade/doc/user-manual/"&gt;Eyegrade User Manual&lt;/a&gt; contains
up-to-date instructions for using the new interface. If you have
Eyegrade 0.1.x installed, you need to install PyQt and change the
value of an environment variable. See the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.it.uc3m.es/jaf/eyegrade/doc/user-manual/#upgrading-from-eyegrade-0-1-x-to-eyegrade-0-2"&gt;section about upgrading
Eyegrade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new user interface will facilitate other usability improvements
in the future, such as the possibility of reviewing previously graded
exams, editing the student list, writing grades to disk in several
orders and formats, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
