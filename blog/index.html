        <p>I'm planning the next major release (0.3) of Eyegrade for
September. There are some features I have in mind, but listening to
the users from time to time does not harm ;) If there is a feature you
are especially interested in, just let me know by commenting on this
post.</p>
<p>Apart from some polishing here and there, these are things I'm
thinking about:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Right now, you can review and fix detection errors in an exam only
at the moment you scan it. What if you discover an error later on?
It think it would be great if the interface allowed you to open a
grading session anytime later and use the same reviewing/fixing
features.  This feature would probably include a list of students
and grades in the interface, so that you can quickly access the exam
of a specific student.</li>
<li>A user interface for entering the questions of an exam, creating the
PDFs, etc. This would probably include dropping LaTeX in favor of
something else (my main option is the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.reportlab.com/software/opensource/">ReportLab library</a>). Using the
current command-line interface and LaTeX would still be possible,
but not the preferred method.</li>
<li>Making life easier for users that only want to use Eyegrade for
grading, but not for creating the exams. I include here features
such as creating a <cite>.eye</cite> file through guided dialogues or creating
the PDF of a personalized answer sheet in the user interface.  It's
about time to close <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jfisteus/eyegrade/issues/36">issue 36</a>.</li>
<li>Adapting the user interface for multiple languages. I can start with
an English, Spanish and Galician interface, and wait for volunteers
to translate it to other tongues.</li>
</ul>
<p>I won't have time for all the features in the list, so you can help me
to prioritize. Of course, you can also request features not in the
list ;)</p>

        <p>Eyegrade 0.2 has been released! It features the shiny new PyQt-based
user interface that I showed in previous posts.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.it.uc3m.es/jaf/eyegrade/doc/user-manual/">Eyegrade User Manual</a> contains
up-to-date instructions for using the new interface. If you have
Eyegrade 0.1.x installed, you need to install PyQt and change the
value of an environment variable. See the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.it.uc3m.es/jaf/eyegrade/doc/user-manual/#upgrading-from-eyegrade-0-1-x-to-eyegrade-0-2">section about upgrading
Eyegrade</a>.</p>
<p>This new user interface will facilitate other usability improvements
in the future, such as the possibility of reviewing previously graded
exams, editing the student list, writing grades to disk in several
orders and formats, etc.</p>
<p>If you experience problems with this new version, please let me know
by commenting on this blog or <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jfisteus/eyegrade/issues?sort=created&amp;state=open">posting an issue at GitHub</a>.</p>

        <p>I've been working on the <em>new session</em> dialog. Now it is a wizard with
three pages. The main novelties are that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You can now select more than one student list. All of them are used
when detecting the student id.</li>
<li>You can now enter the scores for correct and incorrect answers. If
the exam configuration file already contains the scores, you'll see
them as default values. In addition, you can let Eyegrade choose
appropriate values for you, by just entering the maximum score of
the exam and choosing whether incorrect answers should penalize or
not.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can try the new dialog in the development branch at GitHub, and
see it this <a class="reference external" href="galleries/screenshots-new-gui-2/">screenshots gallery</a>!</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="Screenshot of a page of the new session dialog" class="thumbnail" src="galleries/screenshots-new-gui-2/screenshot-3.png">
</div>
<p>This new dialog will appear in the 0.2 release. I have in mind for a
future release the possibility of entering the exam configuration from
the new session dialog, as an alternative to reading it from a
file. This may be handy for users who do not create the exam with the
command line tools that Eyegrade provides.</p>
<p>Comments and suggestions are welcome.</p>

        <p>I'm programming from scratch the graphical user interface of
Eyegrade. The old user interface uses Pygame. It allowed me to build
the first interface of the program very quickly, but its lack of
graphical components (buttons, dialogues, menus, etc.) was preventing me
from programming a more user-friendly interface.  I've decided to use
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/">PyQt</a> for the
new interface. Why PyQt? I programmed a game with Qt in C++ many years
ago, and I liked the library a lot. With the python bindings, it is
even easier to use.</p>
<p>The new user interface will be released with Eyegrade 0.2 (hopefully,
before the end of January). Check the first <a class="reference external" href="galleries/screenshots-new-gui-1/">screenshots gallery</a>!</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="Screenshot of the new user interface of Eyegrade" class="thumbnail" src="galleries/screenshots-new-gui-1/screenshot-4.png">
</div>
<p>Right now the program does more or less the same as the old interface,
but it will be easier to add new features in the future.</p>
<p>The brave can give it a try before the release (it is available at the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jfisteus/eyegrade">development branch of Eyegrade at GitHub</a>). Suggestions are welcome
(just post a comment here or write me an email.) I have tested it only
in Linux, although it should work in Windows too. If you try it, notice that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You need PyQt (package <em>python-qt4</em> in Debian and Ubuntu).</li>
<li>There is no <cite>src</cite> directory anymore. Following the Python
conventions, the Python files are now directly under the <cite>eyegrade</cite>
subdirectory of the main directory of the project.</li>
<li>The main program does not receive command line arguments. The <cite>.eye</cite>
file and student list are selected at the <em>new session</em> dialog.</li>
</ul>
